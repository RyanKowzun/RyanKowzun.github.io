    <p>The Linux Disto Most Should Choose</p>
    
    <div class="small">
        <p>
            Ahhh... Linux distros or GNU/Linux if you want to be technical, is a wonderful operating system everyone should use. There's many different things that make Linux wonderful, but if I had to choose one thing out of the bunch it would be freedom. As long as you know what you are doing you can do whatever you want to the system, compared to something like Windows or Mac. This freedom also gives you much better privacy, especially with Windows 11 adding it's AI recall feature. This has opened the door for a mass exodus of people from Windows to Linux. I welcome this, however there is a big issue with Linux. Choice.
            <br><br><br>
            Now choice isn't a bad thing but for a beginner you can get easily overwhelmed in choosing your distro. Which brings way to distro hopping, which is something I am way too familiar with. I'll probably make another post about distro hopping.
            <br><br><br>
            If you want the simple answer for the distro you should choose. Just choose Linux Mint.
            <br><br><br>
            It has everything you will need. With it's integrated Flatpaks and easy to toggle items in the settings. If you need something that may not be in Flatpak then you can probably download it. Since most software on Linux will support Ubuntu/Debian packages, it gives Linux Mint the ability to work with 99% of software. This distro is one that you would probably never have to touch the terminal once. I mean, you could probably give this to your grandma and as long as the same software is there, she probably wouldn't tell the difference.
            <br><br><br>
            Now as much as Linux Mint is beginner friendly. I will still say do your research on if it has the software you need or alternatives you need. You don't want to make the switch and realize the Adobe Suite doesn't work on Linux, which you need for your specific field of work.
            <br><br><br><br>
            But what if I am a more tech-savy person. I don't want to feel like a beginner!
            <br><br><br>
            Just use Debian. 
            <br><br><br>
            It is the granddaddy of a large majority of distros. So it is a guarantee that if you find some software on Linux it will work with it. Debian is also stable which in a nutshell means you don't have to worry about an update breaking your system. You may not get the newest things with Debian. But that is not Debian's purpose, Debian is like an old reliable car. Sure it doesn't look the best but it sure is going to outlive a Testla in the long term. A final note is Debian is a great workstation distro because it 'just works' you can focus on your work and not a random issue that happened.
